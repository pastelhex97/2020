   <h2>About Me</h2>
</div>
<p>Thank you for wanting to know more about me. I last updated this website on {{ site.time | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}.</p>
<p>I'm pastelhex. I'm a front-end web developer. I have a wide variety of interests, but most are in the digital sphere. I love making and fixing websites and have been coding since the age of 16. I am fluent in Spanish and English and studied French in high school and university. On my own time during middle school I mainly studied German.</p>
<p>In 2019 I graduated <em>magna cum laude</em> with a degree in information technology. That same year I got my first full-time job.</p>
<p>Currently my favorite activities outside of my main passion of web development are watching anime and movies, playing video games, drawing, creative writing, listening to music and youtube videos, and learning about psychology, true crime, and internet subcultures.</p>
<p>I love my parents, my parrotlets, and my fianc√© Andrew!</p>
